# Acceptance criteria — Provenance Guard

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this service, written in unit 7
**before** you built it.

**All five are yours.** None are given.

An acceptance criterion names a number or something plainly observable. *"The
detector is accurate"* is an opinion — and perfect AI detection isn't possible
anyway, so it's an opinion about something nobody can deliver. *"Of 10 pieces I
wrote myself, at most 1 is labelled high-confidence AI"* is a criterion.

Under each, write a sentence or two on **why that target**. *"I allow at most 1
false positive in 10 because on a writing site a wrong accusation costs more
than a missed detection"* is a real answer.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## Pick numbers you can defend

**Cover at least three of these five areas.** They're prompts, not a form.

| Area | A question it could answer |
|---|---|
| False positives | How often may a human's writing get called AI? |
| Score spread | How far apart should clearly-AI and clearly-human text score? |
| Label coverage | Is every one of your three labels actually reachable? |
| The appeal path | Does an appeal always change status and always get recorded? |
| Bad input | What happens when `text` is missing, empty, or enormous? |

Two things worth knowing before you pick numbers:

- **The expensive mistake is one-sided.** Missing some AI text costs the site a
  little. Accusing a real writer costs that person a lot. A criterion that
  treats both errors as equally bad is describing a system nobody would ship.
- **Unit 8 tests across three trials, and the target has to hold across all
  three.** Your first signal runs a model, so identical input can score
  differently twice. A target of "at most 1 in 10" against trials of 2, 1, 2 is
  a **miss**.

## 1. False positives

Of 10 pieces of text I know are human-written (my own original writing,
varied length and style), at most 1 is labeled high-confidence AI — and this
holds in every one of 3 separate trial runs, not just on average.

**Why this target:** Wrongly accusing a real writer is the expensive mistake
on a writing site, so it gets the tightest ceiling I can hold myself to. 10%
means at most 1 in 10 honest submissions risks a false accusation.

---

## 2. False negatives

Of 10 AI-generated texts I submit (from an LLM, varied prompts and lengths),
at most 2 are labeled high-confidence human — missed detections — in every
one of 3 trial runs.

**Why this target:** Missing some AI-generated text costs the site less than
falsely accusing a human, so this ceiling is deliberately looser than the
false-positive one. The asymmetry is the point, not an oversight.

---

## 3. Label coverage

Each of the three labels (high-confidence human, unsure, high-confidence AI)
is actually produced at least once, demonstrated by three deliberate
submissions: one clearly AI-generated, one clearly human-written, and one
borderline/mixed.

**Why this target:** A label nobody can reach is a sentence that exists in
the code but never reaches a reader. The brief requires all three be
reachable, and the only way to know is to produce each one on purpose.

---

## 4. The appeal path

Every `POST /appeal` call made with a `content_id` that exists in the log
changes that item's status to `under_review` and shows the new status in
`GET /log` immediately afterward — checked across 5 separate appeals, 5 of 5
succeed.

**Why this target:** The appeal is the only correction a wrongly-flagged
writer has. If it silently fails even once, that person has no recourse at
all, which is worse than the wrong label by itself.

---

## 5. Bad input

Each malformed submission type — missing `text`, empty `text`, non-string
`text`, and `text` over 20,000 characters — returns a 400 with a clear error
message on every attempt (2 tries per case, 8/8 total), never a 500 crash,
and is never written to the audit log as a decided item.

**Why this target:** A crash on malformed input is one of the most common
real failures a service has, and a system that can be knocked over by a bad
request isn't ready to sit in front of real writers.

     UNIT 8 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath, like this:

         ## 2. Uncertain cases land in the unsure band

         The system handles uncertain cases well.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 8:** Text I judged borderline scores between
         > 0.4 and 0.6 in at least 4 of 5 cases.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "well" gave me nothing to check. I couldn't
         > reach a verdict from it at all.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "At most 1 of 10 of my own pieces flagged as AI" → "at most 3
            of 10", because 1 of 10 turned out to be hard.

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
